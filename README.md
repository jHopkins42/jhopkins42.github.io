Greetings, fellow personoid.
You have reached the automated non-personal interactivity page for the personoid known as Jeremy Hopkins.  Unfortunately, he is off populating meatspace at the moment and cannot interact with you digitally.  He has left stric... loos... guidelines on how to respond to your queries and has authorized the following comments as a potential reply:

"Hi."

Following that reply, there are additional messages to view.

"If you are reaching out for a query on projects, please contact my business email.  If you do not already have my business email, please contact me at jeremy.hopkins.547@outlook.com.  Media requests will be processed through that email or through my agent, at their earliest convenience.  Please be aware that I do run a hectic life, between the volunteering, the making, the business operations, and the regular job.  (And occasionally I like to go out for food or in for sleep.)  I promise that your communication is important, and I will return your message as quickly as I can.  Be advised this response time will be within 48 hours usually."

As has been noted, the personoid at the other end of this repository of knowledge is involved in a bunch of projects.  Current data on those projects indicates that they include the Shadowrun role playing game (as a player, GM, and Catalyst Demo Team Agent), podcasting, writing, woodworking, blacksmithing, music, reading, resin crafting, and coding.
